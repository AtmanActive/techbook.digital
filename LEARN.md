IT wordbook is a web application providing a searchable database collection of IT keywords, terms, and concepts with descriptive explanations. The application contains tags to filter words by departments within the IT industry:

- `Backend`, `Data`, `Design`, `DevOps`, `Docs`, `Frontend`, `Position`, `QA`, `Security`, `AI` 

During my academic and professional journey, I encounter new words and terms related to IT on a daily basis. This continuous learning process highlighted a need for a digital version of my notebook and to begin compiling, categorizing, and understanding the various terms and concepts I encounter.

To address this need, I decided to create a digital wordbook, a dynamic tool where I could easily add, update, and categorize terms as I encounter them. This wordbook serves both as a personal repository of knowledge, and as a quick reference guide whenever I need to refresh my understanding of specific concepts.

I plan to continue developing this tool, potentially making it accessible to a wider audience who could benefit from a structured, comprehensive, and ever-evolving repository of IT knowledge.
